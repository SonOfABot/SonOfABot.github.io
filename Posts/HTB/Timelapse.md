# Initial Foothold

You can run any enumeration script of your choice 
just run upload "script" (make sure it's in the directory you're running evil-winrm from)

run your sript, you'll notice the powershell history is there, view it

![Screenshot_20220415_080104](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994796/163694199-9317a356-db73-4215-b51d-30d25d6f9036.png)

So we can see a series of instructions

![gif](https://y.yarn.co/b512fbb4-9f85-45d0-bdf6-edbba4d22f3e_text.gif)

We repeat the commands, and we're able to successfully act as the svc_decoy user

# Privilege Escalation

So we see now have to think how to get root after all we have some credentials already
Remeber in the smbclient folder there was a folder of Help blah blah it contained things about ldaps and we from our scans we have ldap3 open ports
So we dump ldaps

![laps python dumping script](https://github.com/n00py/LAPSDumper)

![Screenshot_20220415_075854](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994796/163694505-ae5400c3-262b-43d6-ac5f-eb7af8740142.png)

We have admin password

So now you do understand
![gif](https://media0.giphy.com/media/xUNd9L2VQyFALRuJdC/giphy.gif)

We have to change the commands in history

Copy the password from that dump (my pass is different cos i had to reset the machine half way)

Great we can run actions as admin
we upload nc.exe through our evil-winrm
Turn off win defend or whitelist the upload path (c:\users)

run netcat revshell
