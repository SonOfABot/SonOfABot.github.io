This challenge was just same old wordle but the catch here is, It's with Hackers words
So The thing here was If you had python 3.8 it'll be easy like straight to the point
But I was happy it had a bit of an issue so I learnt something new

# Solution

I had to Install Python 3.8 manually and make sure i enabled sharing during the installation

This Guide helped me [Python 3.8 Manual Installation](https://www.linuxcapable.com/how-to-install-python-3-8-on-ubuntu-22-04-lts/) So You can follow it if you need help

The requirements.txt didn't install for me so I had to do so manually also, did this by checking PyPI online and installing them

```pip install colorama```

```pip install random2```

After the above steps I ran the excutable and it worked this time

```Strings wordle```

This gives you words in the executable

I Used it to make life easier

Pretty easy if you play wordle

And That's a wrap
