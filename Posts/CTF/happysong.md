So for this one we were given a hint

Let's Just Jump Right Into It

# Solution
Firstly we string the Sound to see if there's anything that stands out
```strings happy...blah blah.wav```

And Yes there is, at the bottom of it all there's something about Photoshop and RAW there, also the hint we were given looks like dimensions

Let's make a raw file of it and not chnage the original file 

```cp happy_man.wav happy_man.raw```

Let's view it in a photoshop application (I didn't install the gimp raw plugin so I can't view raw files) Let's use an online Photoshop and set the dimensions accordingly

Wow that was sneaky 

So That's A Wrap !!!
