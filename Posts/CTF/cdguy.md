# Solution

How I went about this was quite direct, I copied (or typed out) the text in the image and searched for it 
Saw a pinterest link in the results and I followed it, It led me to video on youtube

CD Guy 1 - we can solve the first question by putting in the youtube account name

CD Guy 2 - We solve that by providing just the url of the video (note if you've played the video before make sure the url doesn't contain some last playback date ie if you paste url in a browser, it doesn't continue from where you stopped previously)

CD Guy 3 - Just Check his video
