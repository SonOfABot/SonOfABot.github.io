title : My Intro to CTFs
---

# Wow So It's been a month since we did this last ðŸ˜¬
I have so many unpublished B2R writeups, Lot's of Files jumbled on my PC
But With All Honesty I've missed Y'all ðŸ¥º

I've Always Heard About How Good CTFs are, John Hammond, Live Overflow, Ippsec and so many Great Role model out there can't emphasize it enough
Believe me it's worth the whole hype like whole HYPE !!!!
Here I'm going to be documenting my experience in a CTF

# CYSEC-NG CTF

It was an Inter-University CTF, truth is my school doesn't really have a cyber security team xD Just I, my OG friend Kismet and Sudo-l team name = L4u_Pwn$tars 
Pwnstars get it ðŸ‘€

So considering this was my first actual serious CTF, I appreciate my friends who allowed me to really go at it and understood I needed a confidence boost or sorts and left me to solving the tasks, while they guide If I felt lost
I made friends and played with and against my friends and I as happy the competition didn't get between us thos there was tension at one point xD

And yh I was quite pleased with my performance actually 2nd out of 45 teams ðŸ˜Ž
