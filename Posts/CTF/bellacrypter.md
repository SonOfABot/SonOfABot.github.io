# Bella Crypter Was A Fun Challenge

- Tools Used Hashcat/JohnTheRipper, Hashid, modified rockyou.txt wordlist and my secret weapon GOOGLE
  
Let's get Into it 

- First the given hash was identified with hashid

Bcrypt, was the gotten hashid

We can make a quick research bout decoding bcrypt hashes if you will, It'll enhance your understanding

# Using hashcat 
Save the hash to a file
```echo "$2y$12$dwt1bzj6pcyc3dy1fwz5ieeuznr71eenkjkulyptsgbx1h68wsrom" > hash```
``` hashcat -m 3200 hash rockyou.txt```

So now here's the catch decrypting bcrypt generally takes time and I for one think it's not really nice giving them in a ctf unless they have the time or hont on maybe decoded string length yuh zimmi ??

What's 4 days ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜¹
In truth it took around 5 hours or so 

# Google
Here's Where Google Comes in
Looking up the hash I saw It's same as the one on THM
Now I Recall Solving something similar

We grep letter words from rockyou.txt

Run hash cat again

Seems better now ðŸ˜¹

So now we wait

We got bleh as the decoded string

We done
