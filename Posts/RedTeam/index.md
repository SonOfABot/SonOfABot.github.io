# Red Team Practice

Welcome to my Red Team Practice section. Here, I'll be sharing my journey into the world of red teaming, covering topics such as tools, techniques, methodologies, and real-world simulations that mimic advanced adversaries. Red teaming is an essential component of offensive security, focusing on simulating persistent threats to evaluate and improve an organizationâ€™s security posture.

## **Write-ups and Tools**
As I progress, this section will be updated with:

- Tool reviews and usage guides
- Red team engagement methodologies
- Adversary simulation techniques
- Post-exploitation tactics
- Threat emulation exercises

Stay tuned for detailed write-ups and insights as I delve deeper into red teaming!

> **Note:** This section is a work in progress as I expand my knowledge and experience in red team operations.
