## **Welcome to SOB SECURITY — Where Curiosity Breeds Mastery**
In a world teetering between chaos and control, we walk the fine line of digital shadows, uncovering secrets that others fear to face. Welcome, hacker. You're not here by accident. You've found your way into a space where we explore the art of breaking systems — ethically, of course. From CTFs to Red Team operations, from malware crafting to reverse engineering, this blog is my journey through the labyrinth of my mind, just kidding offensive security practices.

Let's walk this path together. Learn, adapt, and hack the world.

## **UPDATE**
It's been more than 2 years since I updated this. So many of my learnings went offline. Man, blame Obsidian—that note app is so good! I'm thinking of getting a proper domain? Hmm, we'll see. But for now, let's talk about my interests below.

## **Interests**
- I love anything offensive. Breaking into things is a big hobby. I am now considering other domains such as Web3 and AI, but just for fun.
- I worked on an IoT device for my final year project. I would love to learn more about IoT device hacking. Pwn2Own is such a dream!
